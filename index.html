    <h3>Progress so Far!</h3>
    <p>I started coding around 2 months ago, and started doing the IBM Full stack <br>
        software engineering course. However, I felt like there were definetly some gaps <br>
        in my knowledge which is why I decided to apply for the Northcoders bootcamp to get a <br>
        wellrounded experience while learning. 
        Some areas I have covered so far are:
        <ol class="list">
            <li class = "list">HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li class ="list">Javascript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ol>
    There are also some area's I look forward to covering:
    <ul class="list">
        <li class ="list">Node.js</li>
        <li class ="list">React.js</li>
        <li class ="list">Full Application Development</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        When it comes to useful Learning Links, I use:
    </h3>
    <ul class = "list">
        <li class = "list"><a href ="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></li>
        <li class = "list"><a href ="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Freecodecamp</a></li>
        <li class = "list"><a href ="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Completed Projects</h3>
    <p>Any completed future projects will be listed here!<br>
    Time will show how productive I have been on this course!</p>
